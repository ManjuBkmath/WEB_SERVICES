[**Description of this repository**]<br>
This repository includes Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) related technologies and example projects of both SOAP and REST Web Services using JAVA, SpringMVC5 and SpringBoot2. APIs like JAX-WS, JAX-RS and JAXB are adopted along with frameworks as Apache CXF, Jersey and Hibernate/JPA. MySQL is the DBMS. Eclipse has been chosen as the IDE. Dependencies as jackson and jasper are included. And SoapUI and Postman have been used for testing, as well as custom client servers and jsp views. For SOAP, are included: WS-Security (userNameToken, RSA Encryption, XML Hash Signatures and Timestamp), MTOM and Handlers. Also for SOAP, top-down and bottom-up development processes are demonstrated, for new from-scratch API projects as well as for evolving and exposing legacy server systems as Web Services APIs with minimum changes to their original code and architecture. For REST, are demonstrated: sample Restful APIs with DB Persistency, Rest Security (authentication, authorization, BCrypt Encryption, OAuth2 Tokens), error handling, asynchronous consumer/producer communication, Attachments. XML, XSD, WSDL and JSON are extensively used throughout the examples. JAVA8+ compatible.

This repository is a collection of FINISHED projects, with no .git commit history (for each project separately) and NOT subject to change or contributions. The purpose of this and of other similar "academics" repositories in my account has been merely to store finished projects in a cloud backup, not for continuous or shared development. In case you wanna follow, issue, fork or contribute with pull requests to UNDER DEVELOPMENT projects of mine, please look for the individual repo of each respective project in my account - https://github.com/danielpm1982?tab=repositories - instead of in these "academics" repositories. From February 2020 on, when under development projects are finished, I'll still copy them to "academics" repos (as unmodifiable backups and with no .git history) but I'll start leaving the original development repositories undeleted at my account as well... with all .git commit and other git objects history available.
