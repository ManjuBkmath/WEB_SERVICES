This repository includes Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) related technologies and example projects of both SOAP and REST WebServices using JAVA. APIs like JAX-WS, JAX-RS, JAXB and JPA are adopted along with frameworks as Apache CXF, Jersey, SpringBoot2, SpringMVC5 and Hibernate. MySQL is the DBMS. Eclipse has been chosen as the IDE. Dependencies as jackson and jasper are included. And SoapUI and Postman have been used for testing, as well as custom client servers and jsp views. WS Standards, as WS-Security (tokens, encryption, XML signature), MTOM, WS-Addressing, WS-Policy, WS-SecureConversation, WS-SecurityPolicy are also exemplified, as well as error handling. Top-down and bottom-up development processes are followed, for new from-scratch projects as well as for evolving and exposing legacy server systems as WebServices with minimum changes to their original code and architecture. XML, XSD, WSDL and JSON are extensively used throughout the examples. JAVA8 compatible.
