This repository includes Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) related technologies and example projects of both SOAP and REST WebServices using JAVA. JAX-WS, JAX-RS, JAXB and Apache CXF APIs and maven plugins are used, along with Spring / SpringBoot frameworks. Eclipse has been used as the IDE. And SoapUI and Postman have been used for testing, as well as custom client servers and custom jsp views. WS Standards, as WS-Security (tokens, encryption, XML signature), MTOM, WS-Addressing, WS-Policy, WS-SecureConversation, WS-SecurityPolicy are also exemplified, as well as error handling. Top-down and bottom-up development processes are used, for new from-scratch projects as well as for evolving and exposing legacy server systems as WebServices with minimum changes to their original code and architecture. XML, XSD, WSDL and JSON are extensively used throughout the examples. JAVA10+ compatible.
