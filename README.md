This repository includes Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) related technologies and example projects of both SOAP and REST Web Services using JAVA, SpringMVC5 and SpringBoot2. APIs like JAX-WS, JAX-RS and JAXB are adopted along with frameworks as Apache CXF, Jersey and Hibernate/JPA. MySQL is the DBMS. Eclipse has been chosen as the IDE. Dependencies as jackson and jasper are included. And SoapUI and Postman have been used for testing, as well as custom client servers and jsp views. For SOAP, are included: WS-Security (userNameToken, RSA Encryption, XML Hash Signatures and Timestamp), MTOM and Handlers. Also for SOAP, top-down and bottom-up development processes are demonstrated, for new from-scratch API projects as well as for evolving and exposing legacy server systems as Web Services APIs with minimum changes to their original code and architecture. For REST, are demonstrated: sample Restful APIs with DB Persistency, Rest Security (authentication, authorization, BCrypt Encryption, OAuth2 Tokens), error handling, asynchronous consumer/producer communication, Attachments. XML, XSD, WSDL and JSON are extensively used throughout the examples. JAVA8 compatible.
